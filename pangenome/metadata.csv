Importantly a small number of serovars of Salmonella are responsible for the majority of cases of human salmonellosis. Salmonella enterica serovars typically exhibit a limited range of animal hosts, often referred to as serovar-host specificity. Swine, cattle, and poultry each carry different strains of Salmonella and only certain strains cause infectious disease in these hosts, with the remaining strains carried in a subclinical status or in a commensal relationship. In recent years, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported a rise in human foodborne illnesses related to antibiotic resistant Salmonella enterica serovar I 4,[5], 12:i:- largely associated with the consumption of contaminated pork. Salmonella I 4,[5], 12:i:- is a serovar antigenically similar to Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium; however, it lacks the phase two flagellar antigen making it a monophasic variant.","collected_by:USDA in College Station, TX",99.8,98.4,,,,Good,2019-09-30T10:13:49.083Z,2019-09-30T10:13:49.083Z,No_RNA_Seq,

Salmonella enterica serovars typically exhibit a limited range of animal hosts, often referred to as serovar-host specificity. Swine, cattle, and poultry each carry different strains of Salmonella and only certain strains cause infectious disease in these hosts, with the remaining strains carried in a subclinical status or in a commensal relationship. In recent years, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported a rise in human foodborne illnesses related to antibiotic resistant Salmonella enterica serovar I 4,[5], 12:i:- largely associated with the consumption of contaminated pork. Salmonella I 4,[5], 12:i:- is a serovar antigenically similar to Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium; however, it lacks the phase two flagellar antigen making it a monophasic variant.","collected_by:USDA in College Station, TX",99.9,98.8,,,,Good,2019-09-30T10:17:43.853Z,2019-09-30T10:17:43.853Z,No_RNA_Seq,

The global epidemic of multidrug-resistant Salmonella Typhimurium DT104 provides an important example, both in terms of the agent and its resistance, of a widely disseminated zoonotic pathogen. Here, with an unprecedented national collection of isolates collected contemporaneously from humans and animals and including a sample of internationally derived isolates, we have used whole-genome sequencing to dissect the phylogenetic associations of the bacterium and its antimicrobial resistance genes through the course of an epidemic. Contrary to current tenets supporting a single homogeneous epidemic, we demonstrate that the bacterium and its resistance genes were largely maintained within animal and human populations separately and that there was limited transmission, in either direction. We also show considerable variation in the resistance profiles, in contrast to the largely stable bacterial core genome, which emphasizes the critical importance of integrated genotypic data sets in understanding the ecology of bacterial zoonoses and antimicrobial resistance.",isolate:V113,99.8,99,100,,,Good,2016-01-17T16:49:05.084Z,2016-01-17T16:49:05.084Z,No_RNA_Seq,

Importantly a small number of serovars of Salmonella are responsible for the majority of cases of human salmonellosis. Salmonella enterica serovars typically exhibit a limited range of animal hosts, often referred to as serovar-host specificity. Swine, cattle, and poultry each carry different strains of Salmonella and only certain strains cause infectious disease in these hosts, with the remaining strains carried in a subclinical status or in a commensal relationship. In recent years, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported a rise in human foodborne illnesses related to antibiotic resistant Salmonella enterica serovar I 4,[5], 12:i:- largely associated with the consumption of contaminated pork. Salmonella I 4,[5], 12:i:- is a serovar antigenically similar to Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium; however, it lacks the phase two flagellar antigen making it a monophasic variant.","collected_by:USDA in College Station, TX",99.8,98.9,,,,Good,2019-09-30T10:10:14.733Z,2019-09-30T10:10:14.733Z,No_RNA_Seq,

Salmonella enterica serovars typically exhibit a limited range of animal hosts, often referred to as serovar-host specificity. Swine, cattle, and poultry each carry different strains of Salmonella and only certain strains cause infectious disease in these hosts, with the remaining strains carried in a subclinical status or in a commensal relationship. In recent years, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported a rise in human foodborne illnesses related to antibiotic resistant Salmonella enterica serovar I 4,[5], 12:i:- largely associated with the consumption of contaminated pork.

Here, with an unprecedented national collection of isolates collected contemporaneously from humans and animals and including a sample of internationally derived isolates, we have used whole-genome sequencing to dissect the phylogenetic associations of the bacterium and its antimicrobial resistance genes through the course of an epidemic. Contrary to current tenets supporting a single homogeneous epidemic, we demonstrate that the bacterium and its resistance genes were largely maintained within animal and human populations separately and that there was limited transmission, in either direction. We also show considerable variation in the resistance profiles, in contrast to the largely stable bacterial core genome, which emphasizes the critical importance of integrated genotypic data sets in understanding the ecology of bacterial zoonoses and antimicrobial resistance.",isolate:V85,99.8,99,100,,,Good,2016-01-17T16:47:15.701Z,2016-01-17T16:47:15.701Z,No_RNA_Seq,

Salmonella enterica serovars typically exhibit a limited range of animal hosts, often referred to as serovar-host specificity. Swine, cattle, and poultry each carry different strains of Salmonella and only certain strains cause infectious disease in these hosts, with the remaining strains carried in a subclinical status or in a commensal relationship.

Here, with an unprecedented national collection of isolates collected contemporaneously from humans and animals and including a sample of internationally derived isolates, we have used whole-genome sequencing to dissect the phylogenetic associations of the bacterium and its antimicrobial resistance genes through the course of an epidemic. Contrary to current tenets supporting a single homogeneous epidemic, we demonstrate that the bacterium and its resistance genes were largely maintained within animal and human populations separately and that there was limited transmission, in either direction. We also show considerable variation in the resistance profiles, in contrast to the largely stable bacterial core genome, which emphasizes the critical importance of integrated genotypic data sets in understanding the ecology of bacterial zoonoses and antimicrobial resistance.",isolate:V02,99.8,99,100,,,Good,2016-01-17T16:48:51.968Z,2016-01-17T16:48:51.968Z,No_RNA_Seq,

D23580.Whereas most non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) are associated with gastroenteritis there has been a dramatic increase in reports of NTS-associated invasive disease in Sub-Saharan Africa. Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium isolates are responsible for a significant proportion of the reported invasive NTS in this region. Multi locus sequence analysis of invasive S. Typhimurium from Malawi and Kenya identified a dominant type, designated ST313, currently rarely reported outside Africa. Whole genome sequencing of a multiple drug resistant (MDR) ST313 NTS isolate, D23580, identified a distinct prophage repertoire and a composite genetic element encoding MDR genes located on a virulence-associated plasmid. Further, there was evidence of genome degradation, including pseudogene formation and chromosomal  deletions, when compared to other S. Typhimurium genome sequences. Some of this genome degradation involved genes previously implicated in virulence of S. Typhimurium or genes for which the orthologues in S. Typhi are either pseudogenes or are absent. Genome analysis of other epidemic ST313 isolates from Malawi and Kenya provided evidence for micro-evolution and clonal replacement in the field.",,99.9,99.4,100,0.2,,Good,2014-12-08T22:12:52.628Z,2015-03-16T03:17:09.594Z,RNA_Seq,D23580
